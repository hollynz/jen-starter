# Jen

> Jen is a lightweight Javascript library for radid development of static websites. It was built with a focus on ease of use for developers and working seamlessly with headless APIs and static website hosting.

## How does it work?
Jen leverages Mozilla's rich and powerful [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating language together with Gulp tasks to manage project template files and generate an optimised public directory. Data for the application is retrieved from a JSON data file in the project, making it especially suitable for building API driven websites. The data file can be populated on-demand during development or on-build for in-production static websites.

Aside from Nunjucks and Gulp, Jen is completely unopinionated about what technologies are used, putting the control in the hands of the developer.

A starter project for Jen is available here: [Jen Starter](). The build process for this project includes:
* Sass preprocessing
* Nunjucks/HTML for templating
* CSS concatenation and minification
* Javascript concatenation and uglification
* Multi-browser live browser reload
* Master-detail pattern
* A modular, reusable design


## Installation
Install Jen and Gulp:
````
npm i --save-dev jen gulp
````

## Setup
First, create a gulpfile.js in the root of your project and include the following:

### Require the dependencies:
````
const gulp = require('gulp');
require('jen')(gulp);
````

### Development Gulp task:
````
gulp.task(
  'default',
  gulp.series('jen:dev') //include other gulp tasks as you wish
);
````

### Build Gulp task:
````
gulp.task('build', gulp.series('jen:build'));
````

### Project structure
Jen assumes the following project structure:
````
|--src // required
    |--data // required, but folder and contents will be auto-generated if you supply a dataUrl
        |--db.json // required
    |--templates //required
        |--pages //required
            |--home //required. This is the homepage folder. Other pages can be added in the same manner
                |--index.html //required
|--gulpfile.js // required
````

### Load the data
Data can be loaded in three ways:
1. Manually add a JSON data file to the data folder.
2. Load remote data by running ````gulp jen:load --dataUrl 'http://example.com/api/whatever'````
3. Load remote data and build the project by running ````gulp jen:build````

## Running for development
````
gulp jen:dev
````

## Detail pages
If your website requires use of the master-detail pattern (i.e. a list page and a detail page), you can achieve this by putting a "detail" folder inside your page folder. For example:
````
...
        |--pages
        ...
            |--blog // page folder
                |--detail
                    |--index.html // this is your detail page
                |--index.html //this is your list page
...
````
So, if a blog entry has an ID of "abc123", the detail page would be accessible at:
````
/blogs/abc123
````
